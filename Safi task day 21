+ # Day 21 - SPEED TYPING ( LEVEL 2)
+
+ you must rewrite all four from scratch:
+
+ 1. Ansible:
+    - Install nginx
+    - Start + enebale service
+
+ 2. Terraform:
+    - Create EC2 (choose any Pathnnex-approved type)
+    - Tag it with:
+        Owner: PathnexStudent
+
+ 3. Kubernetes:
+     - Deployment with 3 replicas
+     - Image: nginx
+
+ 4. Shell:
+     - print date, uptime, disk usage
+
+   TIME LIMIT: 15 minutes
+
+ # Multi-Environment Pipeline
+
+ ## Jenkins Pipeline - Deploy to Multiple Enironments
+ You will learn how to **define multiple environment deployments in one pipeline**.
